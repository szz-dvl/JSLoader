- In-progress:
   - Big refactor, Shortcuts + Page Action + Opt Page ===> enough!     
	 
- Not started yet:
	- Policy for disabling scripts (to be designed) => Domain scripts, Site Scripts, Group Scripts. As it is?? 
	
- Big fails:
    - Something is registering rules!
    - Cascade removes fails at some point.
	- Inform user of unpersisted data on views.
    - Opened windows after browser crash ==> to be recovered.
	
- Unavailable?
	- Use console editor (devtools/sourceeditor/editor) in foreground pages ? 

- To be tested:
	- Rules service from conetent script.
	- Rules gral.
	- Import/Export features.
	- Data origin ====> support for MongoDB only.
	
- Finally:

  - Style everything up!
  - Initial examples for each info recipient.
  - Prevent context menu on extension windows.
  - Existing tabs are recreated when opening URLs from listener.
  - Opening page action from shortcut command fails with: "pageAction.openPopup may only be called from a user input handler"
  - Add new groups in opt page.
  - Script name changes not persisted when done from PA.
