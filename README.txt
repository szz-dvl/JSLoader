- To-Do: 

	- Prevent context menu on extension windows.
	- Settings page: Configurations lost when saving Proxys.

-Not started yet:
	- Policy for disabling scripts (to be designed) => Domain scripts, Site Scripts, Group Scripts.
	- Opened windows after browser crash ==> to be recovered.
	- Data origin

- Big fails:
    - Something is registering rules!
    - Cascade removes fails at some point.
	- Inform user of unpersisted data on views.
  	 	 
- Really not done:
  	- Style everything up!
	- Initial examples for each info recipient.
	
-Unavailable?
	- Use console editor (devtools/sourceeditor/editor) in foreground pages ? 

-To be tested:
	- Rules service from conetent script.
	- Rules gral.
	- Import/Export features.
	
- Finally
  - Big refactor, Shortcuts + Page Action + Opt Page ===> enough!
